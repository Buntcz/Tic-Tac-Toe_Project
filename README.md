# Tic-Tac-Toe_Project
So I made the player objects, I am currently thinking about how to make so every cell has an index so I can use those indexes to make a win-checker and also a way to play it in the console via an array. I need to think how to make some of them into factory functions(Im having hard time with those.).
So in general what i did today:
1. The HTML structure.
2. CSS styling of the main elements.
3. JS player objects.

What do I still need to make:
1. Array that stores the valeus.
2. JS function when placing a marker.
3. JS function so player1 and player2 take turns.
4. Winning logic function.
5. Reset button working.

Optional stuff:
1. text under the gameboard to see whose player turn it is.
